\title{
 Calculate allele frequencies
}
\description{
  Calculate for a number of regularly spaced markers the relative frequency of each ancestor in the population.
}
\usage{
calculate_allele_frequencies(source_pop, step_size, progress_bar)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{source_pop}{
  Population for which to estimate allele frequencies
}
  \item{step_size}{
  Distance between markers, a smaller step_size provides a more complete overview, but is also more computationally heavy.
}
\item{progress_bar}{
   Displays a progress_bar if TRUE. Default value is TRUE
}
}
\details{
  Markers are equidistantly spaced, with a distance of \code{step_size} in between them.
}
\value{
  A tibble containing the allele frequencies
}
