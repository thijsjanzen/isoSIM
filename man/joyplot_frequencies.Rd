\title{
 make a joy plot of the distribution of allele frequencies within a region
}
\description{
 This function plots the distribution of allele frequencies within a region over time, making use of a 'joyplot'
}
\usage{
joyplot_frequencies(frequencies, time_points, picked_ancestor)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{frequencies}{
    A tibble containing four columns: \code{time}, \code{location}, \code{ancestor}, \code{frequency}. Typically one of the items returned by \code{create_population_selection} or \code{select_population} when the user specifies \code{track_frequency}.
}
  \item{time_points}{
    A sequence of time points for which the user wants to create the joyplot
}
  \item{picked_ancestor}{
    Default is "ALL", where different colors indicate different ancestors. Alternatively, for clarity, the user can specify a specific ancestral allele, and only that allele is plotted
}
}
\value{
  a ggplot2 object
}
