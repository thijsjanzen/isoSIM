\title{
 Plot the change in frequency between the start and end of a simulation
}
\description{
 This function plots the change in frequency of one or multiple ancestors after performing a simulation.
}
\usage{
plot_difference_frequencies(results, picked_ancestor = "ALL")
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{results}{
    An object which is the result of \code{select_population} or \code{create_population_selection}, being a list with four properties: \code{population}, \code{frequencies}, \code{initial_frequencies} and \code{final frequencies}
}

  \item{picked_ancestor}{
    Default is "ALL", where different colors indicate different ancestors. Alternatively, for clarity, the user can specify a specific ancestral allele, and only that allele is plotted
}
}
\value{
  a ggplot2 object
}
